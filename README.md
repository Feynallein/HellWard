# HellWard
HellWard is my entry for the Ludum Dare #55 which has for theme : Summoning.

### Pitch
Step into the role of a divine ambassador, tasked with defending against a nefarious ritual that threatens to plunge the world into darkness. Confronted by a towering pentacle and an insidious necromancer, you stand your ground knowing that the end draws near. With only the holy light within you to rely on, brace yourself for relentless waves of monstrous foes sent by the necromancer. How long can you withstand the onslaught and protect the realm from ultimate doom? Prepare for an immersive defense experience where your faith and resilience will be put to the ultimate test.

### The team
Me.

When starting this jam, I wanted to compete in the Compo. Unfortunatly, I am not able to produce (good enough!) art and music for games I enjoy doing and am proud showcasing to others so I didn't opt for the Compo. Though, I still decided to work alone, and to only work within 48h (In fact, I worked for ~20h) on this project as a challenge.
